# Chris Lee Bergstrom

**Entertainment industry consulting meets artificial intelligence.**

I build AI-integrated production systems — tools where the AI layer isn't an afterthought, it's a first-class citizen of the architecture. My codebases are designed for human-AI collaborative development: verbose documentation written for future models, explicit decision rationale, and self-aware systems that understand their own structure.

### What I'm Building

**[CLB Consulting Website](https://github.com/Nxtvanhalen/Website)** — Next.js portfolio platform featuring EVE, a self-aware AI concierge powered by GPT-5. Full production deployment with nonce-based CSP, WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility, structured data on every page, and a service worker with tiered caching. The codebase itself is a demonstration of AI-first development practices.

**[Chester AI Chess](https://github.com/Nxtvanhalen/ai-chess)** — Full-stack chess app with an AI companion named Chester. Custom minimax engine with alpha-beta pruning, opening book, and transposition tables. Chester provides real-time move commentary via Claude API with streaming SSE responses. Supabase auth + RLS, Stripe subscriptions, Elo rating system, and a PWA install flow. Live at [chesterchess.com](https://www.chesterchess.com).

**[Byte Email](https://github.com/Nxtvanhalen/byte-email)** — An AI you talk to over email. Send a message to byte@firstlyte.co and get an intelligent response — no app, no login, no website. Built with Bun + Hono, hybrid LLM routing (DeepSeek for text, Claude for vision), Redis conversation threading, and a resilience system with retry coverage on every external call.

### AI-First Development

I write code for the future — where the next person reading your codebase is more likely to be an AI agent than a junior developer. That means:

- Documentation that explains the _why_, not just the _what_
- Architecture that's navigable by codebase exploration tools
- No tribal knowledge — every environment quirk, every workaround, documented with context
- Systems that are self-aware: EVE knows her own API routes, Byte knows its own rate limits
